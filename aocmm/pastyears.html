        <p style="font-size: 3vmin;">The first AoCMM competition hosted 111 teams from 13 different countries, and a variety of backgrounds. Most of the teams have never participated in any math modeling competitions before, making AoCMM their first exposure in the field. AoCMM primarily
          focuses on bringing math modeling to those who have never been exposed to this fascinating field before, so we are glad to see so many students interested in math modeling! Most of our competitors are high school students, a group that is hugely
          underrepresented in the field of math modeling.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 3vmin;">Unlike most other competitions, AoCMM gives competitors the option to solve two problems of different types, as well as not requiring that both problems be completed. Competitors could choose either one or both to complete. We believe that this
          ensures the teams have the chance to demonstrate a more thorough understanding of math modeling through their reports, allowing judges to provide more detailed feedback on every aspect of their abilities.</p>

        <blockquote>"The first annual AoCMM competition was a great experience for our entire team. None of us had ever done any modeling competitions before so the entire ordeal was new to us. The four of us came into the competition with varying levels of experience
          but we all gained something from participating.
          <br/>
          <br/>For future competitors, some things to keep in mind are manage your time well, bring your enthusiasm, and be ready for an intellectual marathon! It is important to plan out exactly what you want to accomplish and set goals for your group to
          avoid cramming and stressing an hour before the submission deadline. Be sure to clear your weekend and set aside more time than you think necessary as some parts may take longer than expected. At the same time, schedule hour long breaks and
          get enough sleep to let your mind rest, recuperate, and work more efficiently.
          <br/>
          <br/>Overall the competition was a great way for us to improve in a variety of skills including modeling and teamwork. We would recommend AoCMM to anyone!"</blockquote>

        <blockquote>"AoCMM 2015 is my first math modeling contest-----it was really fun and intriguing!
The problems were really challenging, especially the second one, since the functioning GPS was something that my friend and I were totally unfamiliar with. And the hard part lies in the limited time, during which we needed to pore over background information, form our ideas, write the solution and computer programming....
     <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we had only two people in the team, there indeed ain't enough time for us to track all these issues, so we decided to focus more on building the model and analyze the approach we use than programming and seeking numerical result (Another reason was because neither of us was proficient in programming).
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our models were built on our own interpretation of the problems, and we tried to make them as specific as possible. For example, we illustrated a test design depending on student profile (problem 1), and used matrices to represent the input (student profile) as well as the output (expected score). We also defined the ideal score distribution to be the normal distribution. In our solution to the second problem, we simplifies the problem by analyzing two time-independent GPS constellations. We also designed ways to test instant visibility and compute the expected visibility period of a location on earth in order to ensure the functioning of the system.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the competition, Zhengzhi and I cracked the first problem together, and as I started to formulate down our ideas and write the solution paper, Zhengzhi set out for background information on GPS. This is just a way to save time and make efficiency. (Well, after the three-day competition, I think I would recommend coming with a team of three or four. This will make everyone more focused and less stressed.)
After all, it's truly a great experience with AoCMM. Look forward to attending next year!"</blockquote>

By taking this challenge, we not only embraced the chance to study and practice mathematical modeling but also appraised our academic abilities. Also did we realized that, frankly, we still have a long way to go.

<br/><br/>However, taking part in this competition really triggered our interests in exploring further and deeper in the field of modeling as well as math. Given more time, we would be able to make significant progress while confidently prepare for the next time.

              <p>Dear Team #864,
                <br/>
                <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start, most of your paper is neatly presented, with an understandable approach to the problem. All the necessary sections are included and graphs are clearly labeled. However, there are quite a few noticeable
                problems: First, you must make sure that you understand what each section of the paper is supposed to incorporate. If you need any clarifications, you can always check out the AoCMM grading rubric, which can be found on http://www.aocmm.net2015-rubric.
                Specifically, the introduction should be about the background of the problem; you must restate the problem in your “own words”, not just simply copying the original problem. Your summary actually covers a lot about the topics that should
                be in the introduction, so it would be better to make the summary more concise and move the excess content to the introduction. As arguably the most important section of your paper, your summary should primarily be about how you actually
                address the problem and the results given back by your model. Second, in your paper, you should never talk about yourself, your mathematical modeling ability, or how thankful you are to the competition organizers in your paper (It would
                be much better to send a thank you email instead). Stating that your English skills might not be good enough to explain the problem is not only irrelevant to the problem, but will also reflect badly on your abilities. As judges, we try
                our best to understand your model and give a final score without factoring in your writing skills. However, with this said, no language other than English should appear on your final paper, even the legend of your graphs. Finally, and
                most importantly, the model itself is too simple to address the problem efficiently. Most of your explanations are in plain text and do not have a strong and accurate mathematical element to it. For example, the third graph should be a
                horizontal line according to how you scaled your x-axis. If cumulative probability is intended, you must state so directly. To explain your logic more clearly, try creating a flow chart of your algorithm because most of the time, charts,
                graphs, and tables supplement written explanations very well. In addition, you might also want to include some randomness factors, such as the chance of student A solving problem B decreases as the ability level of student A decreases
                or the difficulty level of problem B increases. Overall, you have a strong understanding of the problem, but need to further enhance your math skills in order to develop a good model that can effectively solve this problem.
                <br/>

              <p>Dear Team #905,
                <br/>
                <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of your paper is neatly presented along with an easily understandable approach to the problem regarding the normal distribution. In terms of readability, it is strong if given more detailed explanation.
                However, there could be some improvements: First, regarding format some of your special characters do not show up. Always make sure to properly convert the file. In the introduction of the model section, you are not supposed to include
                or place formulas. Instead, formulas and their explanations should come later in the “Clear Explanation of Models” section. Also, most of your sensitivity analysis should actually go in the “Clear Explanation of Models” section. This section
                will ultimately be your longest and one of your most important. Furthermore, it’s important to always label your assumptions and justifications as this sets up the parameters of your models. Also remember to consistently reference citations
                within your paper. Second, when writing out explanations it’s important to restate the problem, rather than simply copying the question. Always verify your model with simulation to clearly demonstrate its methodology. When presenting papers
                to judges or the scientific community, one of the key aspects is ensuring they can see your model function with actual data. Keep in mind that your sensitivity analysis should focus on what will happen if the IQ distribution is slightly
                skewed or fails to follow a standard distribution. Its purpose is to test whether your algorithm can survive under alternative assumptions. Can it still present accurate results? Finally, some suggestions of improvement are to expand explanations
                beyond standard concepts such as the normal distribution. Be sure to go more into the details of your model. Try creating a flow chart of your algorithm. Sometimes this becomes clearer than word explanations. Also try evaluating the effectiveness
                of your model through a set standard.

              <p>Dear Team #863,
                <br/>
                <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your paper is overall neatly organized. The problem is thoroughly interpreted, especially through the possible list of questions that need to be answered in your model; however, your summary needs to go under
                the surface and state how your paper actually addresses these problems and what conclusions are obtained. Your summary should always clearly tell the readers how you interpreted the problem, how your model works, and what conclusions are
                drawn from your model. You can mention how the paper uses Pattern Search and Monte Carlo Simulation in your summary, which are both crucial to the development of your model. On a similar note, make sure to cover these points for your conclusion
                as well. Some of your section 1.2 can actually serve part of this purpose. The questions you listed at the beginning of the passage are clearly answered or assumed in the rest of your paper, which is applaudable. Your introduction is very
                thoughtful, introducing a lot of your perspectives on this problem. However, your introduction should provide additional explanation on certain choices made in the model. For example, what motivated the choice of scores of 20 and 80? How
                do you define the total length of the test? What does it mean by “the top students can finish”? How many percentages of students are considered as top students? In addition, the time formula, T1 = 4e^[(A-D11)^2]+1, needs to be modified.
                Currently, if the student’s ability is much higher than the problem difficulty, it will take him more time to solve this problem than if the student’s ability is only a little bit higher than the problem difficulty. This might not be a
                realistic description of the situation. An alternative way is to put A-D1 in the denominator and further manipulate the formula. That way it will take students of higher abilities less time to solve the problem than students of lower abilities.
                On the other hand, for the students who cannot solve the problem, it will take them more time to realize that they can’t solve it if their abilities are higher but still lower than the problem difficulty than if their abilities are much
                lower which means they will probably give up sooner. Moreover, there are few issues with your variable definitions. According to your definitions, each problem should be worth the same amount of points. There is no need to add the difficulty
                of the problem to the total score. Make sure your assumptions are constant throughout the paper and your model clearly matches your explanation. The term “unit points” is never explicitly mentioned besides in the “definitions” section.
                There’s also a small list in section 2.1, the purpose of this list is abstruse. Please state them in complete sentences to be more understandable. Formatting is really good. Many keywords are in bold and graphs are all aesthetically pleasing.
                The paper could be strengthened by including references, like where you found out that the absolute height of the positioning satellite is usually 4 times than the absolute height of the Earth in problem 2. Sensitivity analysis needs some
                touching up: one cannot tell how you varied the initial values based on your explanation. Make sure to be clearer on this. You need more that just a graph to explain the robustness of the model. Problem 2 could be improved by adding discussion
                on the development on the model and its formula. It would have been interesting to read more about the sensitivity of your model as well. It is important to actually show the code. For example, how the program checks whether four lines
                will pass through it without intersecting with the earth. If this is done, and more math is clearly presented on your paper, this will be a great solution. ​ A final remark, all justifications should be in complete sentences to show professionalism
                and clear reasoning. In general, your approach is very creative and a lot of great assumptions made can actually simplify the problem a lot (such as dividing the earth into 4096 regions).
