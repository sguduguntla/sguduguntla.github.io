        <h1>A First Course in Mathmatical Modeling, 5th Edition</h1>
        <h3>by Frank R.Giordano</h3>
        <blockquote>This book gives a brief overview of the field of mathematical modeling, covering topics from modeling using graphs, optimization modeling, to discrete modeling. It also gives a thorough introduction to modeling with calculus, and no calculus knowledge
          is required. For all chapters, it not only teaches you the techniques of modeling, but also gives you an explanation that leads to the conclusion.
          <br/>
          <br/> <em>Recommended for those who might not have a strong math background but are motivated and willing to put in time.</em></blockquote>
